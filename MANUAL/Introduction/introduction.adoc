## Kodiak System Rewrite

To achieve longer automatic travel for saw cutting programs as well as provide
greater flexibility in entering rock cutting programs, a control system level
rewrite was required. In the interest of future system longevity additional design
criteria also included the need to achieve conformance to PLCOpen standards.
Finally, there was a lack of message annunciation to the operator in the as built
control system, a consequence of this was the addition of state messages and alarm
conditions became self evident as being necessary.

In order to extend the saw's automatic mode bed travel to the physical limits of
the machine, the drive would need to accept a number greater than 32,767 in the
word where it receives the commanded position from the PLC. Unfortunately, this
word was only able to accept signed integer which limits the maximum value (due
to scaling) that the drive can accept to 327.67 inches of the available physical
travel. As the drive motion was programmed originally to be absolute, this limited
the ability to use the entire bed. Further inspection reveals that the program entry
the operator has available would not allow cut programs to effectively utilize the
proposed extra bed space if available. To solve the machine limits available to
the operator to run cut programs within, indexed motion was chosen as the alternative
to absolute. This changes the control system design concept from original by relieving
the (long axis) drive of keeping track of machine position, to the PLC being the
motion/position master. The solution for the cut program entry involved creating
two data tables for use to store the values, one for blocks, the other for slabs
(cuts). This combined with pointers and offsets allow for a total of 200 blocks
to be programmed by the operator, with a total of 500 slabs/cuts. This provides
considerable improvement over the original programming capabilities available to
the operator. To bring the PLC program to a comparable PLCOpen standard, involved
writing the program as a machine state, which is also the preferred approach to
motion via drives. This approach also is useful for data handling and manipulation
(like recipes/cut programs), and messaging/alarms.

The purpose of this manual is to provide operators with a solid understanding of
the saw's control system, and specifically how to use it to properly operate the
saw. In it you will find details about the different operator screens of the HMI,
and explanations on their use. Also, each of the HMI Operator screens chapters
has related content that is provided to give the Operator any necessary background
information. Hopefully this manual can be a reference for the Operator in the future.
