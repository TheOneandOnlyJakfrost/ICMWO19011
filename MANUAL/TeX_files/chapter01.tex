\chapter{The Main Screen}
\paragraph{Overview}
The Main Screen is the primary display screen. It is shown at power up, and is where Operation Mode (Hand or Automatic) is selected. It displays the Operator Message Centre which provides the Operator with current and relavent machine state information. There are aslo controls for \textit{Mode \textbf{Hand/Auto}}, \textit{Automatic \textbf{Cycle Start}} and \textit{Automatic \textbf{Cycle Stop}}, plus \textbf{\textit{Machine Full Stop}}. There is an information area for Saw details, and one for the current running cut program. Finally, there are screen navigation keys provided for Operator access to other machine functions.

\paragraph{Main Screen Details}
Main Screen Details are divided into the general categories.
\begin{list}{-}{}
	\item \textbf{Screen Navigation}
	\item \textbf{Operator Message Centre}
	\item \textbf{Saw Information}
	\item \textbf{Program Details}
	\item \textbf{Operation Control}
\end{list}
\paragraph{Screen Navigation}Is performed by using the programmable Function Keys (FKeys) located down the left hand side of the OI Terminal. For the Main Screen there are three screens accessible using the labeled FKey's, \textbf{Alarms}, \textbf{Manual}, and \textbf{Program}.

The Menu Key located on the terminal at the lower left below the FKey's, will return the Operator to the Main Screen, from all other screens.\\

\paragraph{Operator Message Centre}
Is the message display area located on the Main Screen near the Title. It is used to display information for the Operator during machine use. It doesn't display Alarms, that is done on the Alarms Screen, though it will indicate if an Alarm condition exists.

The \textbf{Operator Message Centre} shown above will display information messages for the Operator. If more than one message is active the display will scroll through all messages continuously.
\\
\paragraph{Saw Information}
Is an area where the Operator can see Saw information at a glance. \textbf{Saw Kerf}, \textbf{Cut Depth}, and \textbf{Current Set} are displayed along with the \textbf{Motor Current Actual}.\newline

\\
\\
\textbf{\LARGE ( \textcolor{blue}{i} )} This information is display only, in order to make changes to the saw parameters \textit{Blade Kerf, Cut Depth, and Current Set} the operator must navigate to the Program Screen. Where they may be changed at any time and in any mode, even while running in automatic/manual or faulted. More details on those settings can be found in the chapter dealing with the Cut Program Screen.
\\
\\
\\
\paragraph{Program Details} Display area will show the Operator details about the current block being cut as per the \textit{Cut Program} the Operator entered, while the Mode is automatic and the program is being executed. If the mode is automatic and the program execution is interrupted, or has completed, the display will show the last block details executed. If the Mode is Manual (Hand), and automatic operation has not been started/completed/interrupted, then it will display the first block of the cut program. Otherwise, the display will be the last block details from program execution, the same as if in Automatic mode. 
\\
\\
\textbf{\LARGE \textcolor{blue}{( i )}} The saw will keep track of where it is in the Cut Program execution cycle, even if cycle stop is pressed. Further details about how the Cut Program is executed, and what behaviour to expect from cycle interruption due to completion, alarms or Operator action can be found in the section(s) following.

\paragraph{\textbf{\LARGE \textcolor{blue}{( i )}}} The cut program may be restarted from any position, providing it was \textit{Cycle Stopped}. If the machine was stopped by pressing the \textit{Machine Cycle Stop} Button, the program will need to be re-entered as this is considered a faulted condition initiated by the Operator when machine safety is a concern. The same applies to any Fault generated by other emergent conditions that require the saw to be stopped mid-cycle. If the saw is stopped by pressing the \textit{Cycle Stop} Button, it may be placed into \textit{Hand} by the Operator if manual control is required. From a cycle stopped state, selecting \textit{Auto} and pressing \textit{Cycle Start} will restart the \textit{Cut Program} at the last known cut location and depth.
\paragraph{\textbf{{\LARGE \textcolor{red}{( ! )}}}} Extreme Caution must be exercised when restarting the \textit{Cut Program} after a \textit{Cycle Stop}. If motion in the Long Travel Axis has been made after cycle stopping, there is a high probability that the saw will not return to the exact cut location due to mechanical tolerances in the axis. The saw will move the \textit{Vertical Axis} to the last programmed height when \textit{Cycle Stop} was pressed.
