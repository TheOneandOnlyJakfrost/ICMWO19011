The \textbf{Operator Message Centre} shown above will display information messages for the Operator. If more than one message is active the display will scroll through all messages continuously.
\\
\paragraph{Saw Information}
Is an area where the Operator can see Saw information at a glance. \textbf{Saw Kerf}, \textbf{Cut Depth}, and \textbf{Current Set} are displayed along with the \textbf{Motor Current Actual}.\newline

\\
\textbf{\LARGE ( \textcolor{blue}{i} )} This information is display only, in order to make changes to the saw parameters \textit{Blade Kerf, Cut Depth, and Current Set} the operator must navigate to the Program Screen. Where they may be changed at any time and in any mode, even while running in automatic/manual or faulted. More details on those settings can be found in the chapter dealing with the Cut Program Screen.
\\
\\
\\
\paragraph{Program Details} Display area will show the Operator details about the current block being cut as per the \textit{Cut Program} the Operator entered, while the Mode is automatic and the program is being executed. If the mode is automatic and the program execution is interrupted, or has completed, the display will show the last block details executed. If the Mode is Manual (Hand), and automatic operation has not been started/completed/interrupted, then it will display the first block of the cut program. Otherwise, the display will be the last block details from program execution, the same as if in Automatic mode. 
\\
\\
\textbf{\LARGE \textcolor{blue}{( i )}} The saw will keep track of where it is in the Cut Program execution cycle. Further details about how the Cut Program is executed, and what behaviour to expect from cycle interruption due to completion, alarms or Operator action can be found in the section(s) following.
