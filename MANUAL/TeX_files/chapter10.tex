\chapter{Programming - General Guidelines}
\section{Best Practices}\paragraph*{Block cut programming}can be a lengthy process, with frequent interruptions at times. Using the \textbf{CHECK PROGRAM} screens to verify where you left off is an easy way to continue programming from the correct spot. If you combine this with stroking out, or otherwise indicating completion point on your Operation Sheets, is a good double check practice to use. When starting a new program for cutting blocks with the saw, it is always a good idea to follow these few steps at first ...
\begin{list}{$\diamond$}{}
	\item \textbf{Reset Automatic Sequence}
	\item \textbf{Clear Block Program}
	\item \textbf{Home Saw}
\end{list}
This will ensure the system is ready to start "fresh" with a new program to execute (once the Operator enters it).
\paragraph{\textbf{\LARGE \textcolor{blue}{i}}}The Operator will be prompted by an accept or cancel popup, to either accept clearing the program, or resetting the sequence, or cancel the operation. This is an immediate action and cannot be undone.
